This Email Threat Hunting Tool provides a comprehensive suite of features for advanced email security analysis. In addition to utilizing VirusTotal, URLScan, and Google SafeBrowsing APIs for threat detection, the tool accepts various inputs, such as extracting data and links from Outlook emails. It includes a QR code scanner and URL Finder, allowing flexible input options. A key feature is its ability to process MD5, SHA-1, and SHA-256 hashes, querying VirusTotal to extract relevant data for threat hunting. It also evaluates email headers, analyzing DKIM, DMARC, SPF flags, and other security indicators. The tool generates a detailed report of all findings and quickly determines whether a threat is a true or false positive phishing attempt.
